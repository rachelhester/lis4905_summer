### Week 11 Requirements:

*Deliverables:*

- Create a Python program based upon the following requirements:

    - Use all four intrinsic Python Data Structures: List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary.
        Randomly assign grades of "S" or "U" (satisfactory or unsatisfactory) to each DIS member--of course, not including your ever-kind, ever-caring, ever-compassionate instructor. ;)
        Display code and results to your Bitbucket repo.
        Backward-engineer screenshot below: README.md file should include the following items:

        Screenshot of your Jupyter notebook (see below);
        Upload .ipynb file and create link in README.md;
        - Note: Before uploading .ipynb file, be sure to do the following actions from Kernal menu:
            - a. Restart & Clear Output
            - Restart & Run All
        - Note: Always run the .py files before trying to create a Jupyter notebook using the code from the .py files. If the .py files won't run, neither will the notebook!
